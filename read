üîß 1. Install Python

Make sure Python is installed:

Download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

During installation, make sure to check ‚úÖ "Add Python to PATH".

Verify in terminal:

python --version

üíª 2. Install VS Code

Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Install the Python extension:

Go to Extensions (‚áß‚åòX / Ctrl+Shift+X)

Search for "Python" by Microsoft and install it.

üìÅ 3. Create Your Project Folder

Create a folder and open it in VS Code:

mkdir selenium-project
cd selenium-project
code .

üß™ 4. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv


Activate it:

On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate


On macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

üì¶ 5. Install Selenium

With your virtual environment activated, install Selenium:

pip install selenium


(Optionally) Save dependencies:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

üåê 6. Download the Appropriate WebDriver

Selenium needs a browser driver. Download based on your browser:

Chrome ‚Üí ChromeDriver

Firefox ‚Üí GeckoDriver

Edge ‚Üí Edge WebDriver

Make sure to:

Match driver version to your browser version.

Place the driver in your project folder or system PATH.

üß™ 7. Write a Sample Selenium Script

Create a file test.py:

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# Set path to your chromedriver
service = Service('./chromedriver')  # or full path to chromedriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)

driver.get("https://www.google.com")
print("Title:", driver.title)

search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
search_box.send_keys("Selenium Python")
search_box.submit()

time.sleep(5)
driver.quit()


‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure chromedriver is in the same directory or update the path.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è 8. Run the Script

In VS Code terminal:

python test.py

üß† Tips

Use .env or config files to manage paths if your setup is more complex.

You can install other useful packages like pytest or selenium-wire depending on your needs.

Would you like a setup for a different language (e.g., Java, JavaScript) or browser automation example?
